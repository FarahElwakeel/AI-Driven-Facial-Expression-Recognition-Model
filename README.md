# AI-Driven-Facial-Expression-Recognition-Model

ðŸš€ A deep learningâ€“based system for detecting and classifying human facial expressions in real-time using EfficientNetB2.

## Project Overview

This project is a CNN-based system designed to classify 7 facial expressions â€” Happy, Sad, Angry, Disgust, Fear, Surprise, and Neutral â€” from static or webcam images.

Developed as part of a summer training program at Future University in Egypt, in collaboration with AMIT Learning, and mentored by Mohamed Gomaa, the project explores practical applications in healthcare, security, customer service, and HCI (Human-Computer Interaction).
